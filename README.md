# Weekly Assignment Three :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to follow along with the current cohort's weekly assignment - to be explicit about the steps in creating a fullstack web application, and to model the potential difficulties one could run into. 

## End Goal

 Now "success" is a relative term and may vary from person to person.

I determined that a "successful" application to mean the following:

- I would have become a more competent software engineer. 
  - Good coding practices: comments
  - Setting sprints 
  - Debug well 
  - Really understand the fullstack web application process
- It would have to be engaging, interesting, and meaningful for at least 1 person.

### How to run this package

```
npm install
```

```
node app.js
```

### How it works :open_book:

- [ ] Handlebars 
  - [ ] Categories
  - [ ] Profile
  - [ ] Question 
  - [ ] About
  - [ ] 
- [ ] Controller: 
  - [ ] Router 

- [ ] Model 
  - [x ] friends.json 
  - [ x] orders.json
  - [ x] questions_family.json
  - [x ] questions_friends.json
  - [x ] questions_love.json
  - [ x] questions_work.json 
    - The question 
    - [ ] Grab modal from the MDBootstrap 
    - [ ] See if you can have an arrow that just clicks through a bunch of data points, like a modal sort of thing? 
    - [ ] You also want to add a button to see if you can favorite the question 
    - [ ] Create that for every page 
  - [ ] categories.json
    - [ ] Will be linked to the modal, so technically there might not be a question page 
  - [ ] users.json 
    - This will contain the list of authorized users 
### Where it fits :paperclip:

- [ ] Fullstack Application Web Development
- [ ] Model-View-Controller
- [ ] Data Manipulation  
- [ ] ![SQL Diagram](./sql.png)
- [ ] Postgres
