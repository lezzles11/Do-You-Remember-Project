Dictionary Definitions: 

User: The application only has one user (this is not a social media platform, which means that the user is the person that is using the application).

Group: Each user has one or more groups. There is initially one default group when the user is created (uncategorized group - if the user does not select for the contact to be in a group, then the contact will fall into that group).

Check In: Each contact will be associated with a list of checkins, which itself falls under three categories: an in person check in, a phone call or a note (if it is a note, then the contact’s overall checkin count will not increase). When the user clicks on a contact, they can look through checkins, which contains information they had added about the contact.

Use Case 1: Creating a new contact

The user will be able to add new people that he or she wants to keep in touch with. It will first ask for the contact’s first name and last name. When the user initially adds a new contact, there is an option that the user can choose (what group they belong in). 

The application will also keep a running log of the amount of times that the user has connected with the person.
