    <!-- Section description -->
    <p class="text-muted mx-auto mb-5">What draws us to other people is the drive to connect - to know that our excitements, anxieties, fears and upsets have echoes in the lives of others. However, most interactions are not typically conducted as such - we typically emphasize our successes, never allude to our own anxieties, agree with others constantly, keep it light, and rarely engage in earnest conversation. Do also bear in mind that even though your feelings might seem entirely unique to you, they belong to experiences that most of us do in fact share. One of the points of this exercise is to reveal to us how much we have in common, beneath the surface differences. <br/><br/>Enjoy the pleasures of feeling - at last - understood a little better. </p>

          Some questions here might feel a bit unfamiliar, or awkward. Remember, you're not being judged, just understood. This isn't an exam or interview - only answer what feels fun, interesting and important.

        <p class="text-muted px-2 mb-lg-0">
          When you're listening, your job doesn't end with the initial question you ask. It helps greatly to follow it up with smaller additional questions or comments such as, 'How did that make you feel?', 'Why do you think that might be?', 'I can imagine that...'. <br/>Bear in mind that much communication happens through the eyes and mouth; they are the true guides as to whether you are listening.

        <p class="text-muted px-2 mb-md-0">
          Each player should answer with real honesty. If the game is played properly, it should have moments of true sadness. Encountering the vulnerability of another person is one of the most helpful things that can happen to us - it normalizes our own troubles and allows us to understand the reality, rather than the facade of others.
